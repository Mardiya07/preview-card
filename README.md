## My process

I tackled this project with a mobile first approach. Worked from a top down fashion and styled as I went along. With the desktop view I added constraints to make the page adjust accordinly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming Convention

### Continued development

Upon completion of this project and showing to friends, CSS variables came up in the discussion. Its implementation reduced repetition and helped me make changes to multiple sections by just editing corresponding root variables.
After reading my implementation and you have suggestions that would further improve my work, kindly reach me via my social handles. Would be very much appreciated.

### Useful resources
